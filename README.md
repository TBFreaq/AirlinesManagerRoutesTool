This program helps with route management in Airlines Manager (airlines-manager.com)

You can:
  - Add/Edit Routes to the Overview including:
    - Demand for Economy/Business/First
    - Offer for Economy/Business/First
    - Distance
  - Calculate the best seating configuration for your aircraft based on the route
 
What this tool will do:
  - Show demand in %
  - Show how much seats you're offering on this route (% utilization)

What this tool won't do:
  - Manage your routes directly, meaning it doesn't connect to your account
  - Bake cakes

I hope someone finds this useful! For me it was just an excercise in how to create, edit and manage Access Databases

If you've got any issues don't hesitate to contact me or open an issue!

Plans:
  - Have different languages (German and English will be the main languages // If you want you can translate the UI and I'll include it in the next update!)
  - Maybe price calculation (THIS IS A HUGE MAYBE)
  - Better UI (It's kinda ugly IMHO)
